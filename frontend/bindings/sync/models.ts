/**
 * Map is like a Go map[any]any but is safe for concurrent use
 * by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
 * Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
 * 
 * The Map type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
 * with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
 * easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
 * 
 * The Map type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
 * key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
 * or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
 * sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a Map may significantly reduce lock
 * contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate [Mutex] or [RWMutex].
 * 
 * The zero Map is empty and ready for use. A Map must not be copied after first use.
 * 
 * In the terminology of [the Go memory model], Map arranges that a write operation
 * “synchronizes before” any read operation that observes the effect of the write, where
 * read and write operations are defined as follows.
 * [Map.Load], [Map.LoadAndDelete], [Map.LoadOrStore], [Map.Swap], [Map.CompareAndSwap],
 * and [Map.CompareAndDelete] are read operations;
 * [Map.Delete], [Map.LoadAndDelete], [Map.Store], and [Map.Swap] are write operations;
 * [Map.LoadOrStore] is a write operation when it returns loaded set to false;
 * [Map.CompareAndSwap] is a write operation when it returns swapped set to true;
 * and [Map.CompareAndDelete] is a write operation when it returns deleted set to true.
